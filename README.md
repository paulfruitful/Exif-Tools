# Exif-Tool
 OSINT tools for stripping exif data and collecting exif data from images.

Did you know that pictures can be used to get useful information such as location, so I created two tools to help you to both collect from pictures and to also to strip the pictures of their data.

To get meta-data from pictures you would use Image-Info and to strip pictures of their meta-data you would use Image-stripper.

**Usage Of Image-Info**

First of all when you download the executable file

Move the imageinfo.exe to your User folder and make sure your photos folder is named **Pictures**

Then open the executable and choose the format you want to receive the exif data as, and wait for it to fetch for the data

If you choosed the file format it would create a filed named image-info.txt in the directory and the same thing goes for the CSV format

**Usage of Image-Stripper**

First of all  download the executable file

Move the image-stripper.exe to your User folder and make sure your photos folder is named **Pictures**

Then open the executable and it would automatically iterate the Pictures folder and remove all exif data in each of the images

Your photos are now sucessfully disarmed and you can test that with the Image-Info.

**NB:** You are not allowed to use this tools on people's pictures without their consent
