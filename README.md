# Exif-Tools
Bunch of Exif tools for stripping meta-data and collecting metadata.

Did you know that pictures can be used to get useful information such as location, so I created two tools to help you to both collect from pictures and to also to strip the pictures of their data.

To get meta-data from pictures you would use Image-Info and to strip pictures of their meta-data you would use Image-stripper.

**Usage Of Image-Info**
First of all when you download the executable file

Move the imageinfo.exe to your User folder and make sure your photos folder is named **Pictures**
